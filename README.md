# social-statistics-problem-2

Problem 1:
 
● Analyzed a dataset on program evaluation in non-governmental service agencies
● Used regression analysis to understand the relationship between organizational factors and evaluation-oriented research
● Found that organizational structural factors and cultural factors were positively associated with the average number of hours invested in program evaluation
 
Problem 2:
 
● Investigated the relationship between caloric intake, literacy levels, and life expectancy for females
● Created linear and nonlinear models to understand the relationship
● Found that both caloric intake and female literacy were positively related to life expectancy, but the positive impact of caloric intake was not as strong at higher levels of intake
 
Problem 3:
 
● Analyzed a dataset on penalties assessed in municipal courts for misdemeanor and felony crimes in cities
● Used linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between independent variables and penalties assessed
● Found that the crime rate was the strongest predictor of penalties assessed, followed by the BIPOC population, population size, and unemployment
● Evaluated a new model that tested the interaction between crime and the number of minorities in the city
● Found that the effect of crime on penalties was moderated by the number of minorities in the city, and that the effect of conservative context on penalties depended on the level of BIPOC population.
